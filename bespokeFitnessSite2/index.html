    <p>THE PROBLEM:whats causing anxiety.....later expound the solution The Problem: You want to get fit, feel good but You feel weighed down by a flood of anxiety everytime you try
    even thinking about it gives you a feeling of overwhelm and dread like your head is below water...when you do invest
    in your health, you go to the gym and are avalanched by all the endless options...You feel nervous because other ppl might be looking at you
    and know you have no clue what to do....its intimidating to watch ppl lifting heavy weights TOO MUCH TO DO....so you just hop on th
    treadmill for a few minutes and leave ONLY to repeat the cycle...
    Sometimes its hard to even get up and start your day let alone get the energy needed to go to a gym

      <p>Hi. My name is Emmanuel Able. I live in NYC. Over the past 13 years I have been involved in the Fitness Industry.
        From training myself to training clients. I started to notice that fitness is desired by everyone...Who doesnt want
        to look and feel sexy and confident?...but there was FEAR and ANXIETY surrounding fitness....How long does it take?
        Its going to be painful? I need discipline? Why isnt getting the result FUN?....not to mention the FEAR and ANXIETY
        that We already experienced from life....why add more?
        While working as a Butler in Manhattan for over 4 years...I served at many bachelorette parties where I was completely topless...
        if you picture a man wearing just a collar, bowtie and cuffs....
        topless and then only an apron ....serving you drinks....welcoming your guests
        and arranging and executing your entertainment for the evening
        right on the border of stripping...then you've imagined what an evening with me as your butler was like.

        I started getting requests from girls at the party to train them</p>
