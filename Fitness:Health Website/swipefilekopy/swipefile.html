  <p>1) We Like You TOO :)</p>
  <img src="swipedimages/welikeyoutoo.jpg" height="200" width="200">
  <p>The subconscious mind thinks "Who is we?". "Like You Too" presupposes
    "I Must Already Like You" and the smiley emoticon activates mirror neurons
    in the brain associated with smiling. Neuroscience has shown the brain cannot
    differentiate between an actual smile and an emoji smile :) . This copy works because
     it is aligned with the fundamental sales principle
     people buy from you when they "know you, LIKE you and trust you"</p>
