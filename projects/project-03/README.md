### Overview

This project is another foray into **building a full-stack application**. You'll be **building a Rails app,** which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up with a team.

**This is exciting!** It's a lot, but we've given you the tools to be able build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. And you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

**You will be working in teams for this project**, and you'll be designing the app yourself. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Be a Ruby on Rails and Postgres Application**
* **Have at _least_ 2 models** (more if they make sense) that represents the main functional idea for your app, with a relation between 2 tables
* **CRUD functionality** for at least 1 model
* **Have RESTful routes**
* **Access data from at least ONE external API** with HTTParty or another gem (some APIs may have their own gems!)
* **Utilize a PSQL database** to interact with your stored data and save API data
* **Include wireframes and User stories** that you designed during the planning process
* Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
* **At least 1 Gem we haven't used in class**
* **Be Deployed on Heroku**

---

### Recomended Reach Goals
* **Authentication** with Devise, OAuth, or BCrypt
* **Utilize Active Mailer**
* **Actually Make It Look Good** without using Materialize, or something similar
* **Present In a Tuxedo** or similarly fancy attire
* **Add at least 5 RSpec Tests**

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub** and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
* **User stories** in your readme
* **ERD** diagram for your database setup
* Available online on Heroku

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems**
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _to-do lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, and/or task tracking as specified above?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score for each category between 0 and 3 and tally the total.

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
