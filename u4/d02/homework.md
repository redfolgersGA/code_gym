# Homework - (/^ Regular Expressions \& ES6 $/)

Completion: Parts 1-3


## Part 1 - Regular Expressions

Setup: Use [Rubular](http://rubular.com/) to test out your Regular Expressions, and save your answers in a `script.js` file. You should provide a matching string with your regular expression, as well as at least 2 similar strings which do not pass.

##### 1. Write a regular expression that will grab each string that contains numbers.

##### 2. Write a regular expression that will grab each string that contains only one number.

##### 3. Write a regular expression that will grab each string that only contains uppercase letters.

##### 4. Write a regular expression that will grab each string that contains both numbers and letters.

##### 5. Write a regular expression that will grab each string that contains whitespaces.

##### 6. Write a regular expression that will grab each string that starts with a number and ends with a question mark.

## Part 2 - ES6

Use the new ES6 syntax to complete the following problems:

##### 1. Explain the result of the following code:

```
{ let a = 'I am declared inside an anonymous block'; }
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: a is not defined
```

##### 2. Use .map to add an accomplishment attribute to each object with values: 'Javascript', 'Python', and 'Pizza Margherita'

```
const gods = [
  {name: 'Douglas Crockford'},
  {name: 'Guido van Rossum'},
  {name: 'Raffaele Esposito'}
];
```

##### 3. Use .filter to make a new array of only the vowels (`hint` - Regex would be useful here!):

```
const letters = ["a", "z", "b", "c", "u"];
```

##### 4. Make a class called Phone. Add a constructor method to the Phone class that takes in two arguments, "brand" and "model" which will be equal to `this.brand` and `this.model`.

##### 5. Add a method to the Phone class called `ring` that console logs "your `brand` `model` is getting a call". Create a new instance of the Phone class and invoke the ring method.

Time to show off. For part 3 you will build a personal portfolio site in React! If you already have a portfolio site built that you are happy with, then you will need to create a portfolio website for the instructor of your choice!

Use create-react-app!

##### Requirements
1. You should have some information on the site
 - Perhaps portfolio pieces with images, descriptions, and links
 - Work history
 - about me section
 - Whatever!

3. Make your website look awesome. You can discover other developer portfolios for inspiration!

4. Use your portfolio site as a way to demonstrate your coding abilities, implement cool features.

5. This should be an on going project but spend a few hours working on this today. 

# Bonus!
Continue working on your React checklist!
