// 1 Write function that takes an array of numbers as argument and returns
// a new array with only the odd numbers
var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];


// 2 Write a function that takes an object as an argument and returns
// a new object with only values greater than 10 characters in length
var bagelBites = {
  bagel: "bites",
  pizza: "in the morning, in the evening, at supper time",
  when: "pizza is on a bagel",
  you: "can eat pizza anytime"
};


// 3 Create an function that returns a random number from the number's array
// and uses that number to print each key and value from the bagelBites object
// that number of times


// 4 Create an object called "bagelBitesWorld". This object should contain the
// numbers array, the bagelBites object, and the function you created in number 3

// 5 Write a constructor function which can make instances of a bagelBite. This constructor
// function should take in a type (pepperoni, cheese, sausage, etc) as an argument when
// creating a new bagelBite. Add the numbers array to this constructor and make each method you made
// in #4 a prototype method.
