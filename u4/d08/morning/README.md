# Last Morning Exercise ... :*(

<br>


Today we will be learning a little CS and having fun with sorting algorithms!

#### 1. Watch this video
[Dance Party!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyZQPjUT5B4)

#### 2. Form into groups
Each table can be a group. You will research your assigned sorting algorithm and create a little presentation for the rest of the class.

#### 3. Presentation
For your presentation, use the provided player cards to demonstrate how your group's algorithm would sort your deck of cards from lowest to highest. Bring as much dancing/drama/X-Files-ness as you want! Afterwards give a short explanation of what you learned about your sorting algorithm, and how it applies to your presentation. 

Your team will be matched up with a group in the other class. Work together to figure out the sorting algorithm, then prepare for your Hungarian Dancing Algorithm Presentation! 

#### Assignments
 - Table 1 - Bubble Sort
 - Table 2 - Select Sort
 - Table 3 - Insert Sort
