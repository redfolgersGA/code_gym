### Setup
* run `npm install` in this directory to get all of the dependencies. 


### Assignment
In this directory is a basic React calculator. The UI is built out, but the calculator isn't functional...yet.

Completion will be parts 1-3 and includes getting basic functionality out of this calculator. 

### Tips for Getting Started
* Consider how and where state should be managed for this app. 
* What props will need to be passed around the app?


## 1. Basic click functionality on tiles
* Take the Tile component (each button on the calculator) and create a function that will console.log the value of the button. 
* This function should be passed down as props from the Calculator component. 
* Once you have the basic console.log for each tile click, add some state to the Calculator so that it can hold a current display value. 
* The display component should render the display value determined in the Calculator's state. 
* Finish up this feature by having the display component render the symbol of the tile that you click on. 

## 2. Updating State
* Your calculator should be able to hold on to a few pieces of state: 
    * the current value being displayed
    * the running total
    * the most recent operator
    * make sure you are able to keep track of the numbers that need to be calculated as well as which operation that needs to be done
* You will need to handle numbers and operators differently, and it would be best to write a function for handling each type


## 3. Basic Calculations
* You will need functions for adding, subtracting, multiplication, and division. 
* When the user clicks the "=" tile, run the correct calculation for the given operator, and print the result to the console.
* Finally, after the calculation is completed have the answer displayed correctly on the page. 


# BONUS
1. Write a function to handle clicking the '+/-' button 
2. Write a funciton to handle the '%' button. Ex: 10 % -> 0.10, 22 % -> 0.22
2. Write a function that will show the calculators recent history when you double click on the display component
3. Add animations to the display when changes occur
