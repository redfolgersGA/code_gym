# SLIPPIN' THROUGH THE WEEK

### Let's review some of the concepts we covered so far.
As a programmer, you'll be responsible for knowing your code AND defending your code to the head honchos. Let's get comfortable explaining code to each other!

We'll spend 5-10 minutes researching, and then each student will present their topic for 3 minutes, with questions, to the class. In regards to your topic: What is it? How do we use it? Are there optional parameters? Show us an example! Was there anything else you found interesting about your topic while researching?

Some of these topics we haven't covered in class before and you'll need to research to learn a little about it. Some of these topics are still new. If you don't know much about your topic already this is a great opportunity to figure it out. Don't worry about being incorrect - we'll help nudge you in the right direction!


##### Assignment:
Each student will be randomly paired with a topic, and will present in a random order. We will assign the topics and order right now!
