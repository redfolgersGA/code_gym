### Setup
Work in the `u2/d02/ajax_lesson` directory. You should notice the directory is currently empty (other than this README.md file). Make sure you:
 - create an index.html file
 - create a style.css file
 - create a script.js file
 - add jquery
 - link the css and js files to the index.html file. 



##### Pair Programming
Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. The benefits of pair programming are well documented to cut down on development time and bugs. 

For this lab you will be pair programming with a partner.  

### Assignment
This lab will last the remainder of the day. Work on each section, one at a time. We will review each section together, and let you know when to move on to the next step. 


Part 1: Build HTML & CSS copy
