## Let's shake off some of this server side business with CSS Animations!

### Assignment
For this morning's exercise, pair up with a partner. After picking a CSS animation framework, create a simple web page to show off your newly found animation skills!

1. Choose a partner and an animation framework (5 minutes)

  Please choose from the following options:

  [CSS Shake](https://elrumordelaluz.github.io/csshake/)<br>
  [Hover CSS](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)<br>
  [Magic CSS](http://www.minimamente.com/example/magic_animations/)<br>
  [Animate CSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)

1. Quickly check out the documentation and figure out how to include your library and how to use it! (10 minutes)

1. Create a simple web page using HTML and CSS and add your animations to the page! Try using jQuery so that your animations will be triggered by DOM events such as hover, click, scroll, and anything else! (45 minutes)

1. BE CREATIVE! At 10:00 we will have a mini science fair so every one can show off their animated pages!
