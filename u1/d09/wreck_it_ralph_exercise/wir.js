		// Hey XFiles!
		// --------------
		// Let's have some fun!

	  // I'll do some of the work for you, first I will grab the <body></body>
	  // and I'll create a <div> with the id of ralph. 
	  var $body = $('body');
		var $ralph = $('<div id="ralph1"></div>');

    
	  // 1. Add the class "ralph" to this div. Append $ralph to the page.
	  


	  // 2. Create a .click function on ralph. When you click him, his ID Attribute
	  // should increment by one.
	  // i.e. ralph1 should become ralph2, ralph2 becomes ralph3 and so on...
	  // You'll might into an issue here. Maybe you should log the number you are 
	  // incrementing and then look at the class names in the css file. (DEBUG IT!)
  	


		// 3. There are 11 frames in the total animation. When #ralph11 (the last frame) 
		// is displayed, restart the animation back to the first. 
  	



		// 4. When the counter hits the 5th frame (suprised), you should append a div with
		// the ID of 'speech1' to the page. 
  	


    // 5. On frame 6, reassign the ID attribute of the 'speech1' div to 'speech2'		
  	


    // 6. On frame 7, remove the speech div completely. 		
  	


    // 7. On the last frame, add an alert letting the user know Ralph is just kidding!
  


		// 8. Congratulations! 



		//Bonus: Open the image, explore other series of frames. 
		// Create css rules and write more jQuery to create a new animation.
