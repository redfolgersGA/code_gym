## Setup:

- Open index.html in the browser. 
- Open inspector. Work in inspector to complete the following tasks. 
### Important:

- After you run a successful command, COPY AND PASTE it into a text file. This will save you time and energy if you mess up and have to refresh/restart.  

---

## Set the scene...
- Use a selector to grab the body 
- Add an HTML tag inside of body called `setting`
- An image should appear on the DOM. 

## Characters
- Select your "setting" element
- Add an element inside setting called `characters`

## Homer Arrives
Homer had a long day at the powerplant and has plans to meet Barney at Moe's Tavern

- Inside of the characters element, add  a  `<homer>` element. 

## Barney? 
Barney Shows up late AND he's been drinking all day

- Add a `<barney>` tag inside of the character element.
- Before he appears, you'll have to give the new barney element a classname of `drunk`

## DO'H?

Homer decides (against better judgement) to play catchup.  

- Add 15 elements. they should be called `<duff1>`, `<duff2>`, `<duff3>` ... up top `<duff15>`. 
- They should _not_ be in the character element. 
-  _Bonus if you can do this with a loop_

## Caught up! *BELCH* 

Those are actually 15 empties. 

- Add a class for homer called drunk. 

- He should appear to 'interact' with the cans we just added.

## Time to go!

- Remove barney completely,

- Remove homer completely. 

## Going to Bed!

- Add a new character called sleepinghomer
