## Introduction
The purpose of tonight's homework is to practice some basic HTML and then successfully push it all up to _**your private repo**_ and submit your homework.

## Completion
Complete all parts of tonight's homework and push up to your repo.

## Setup
We will be working in your `d03/homework` directory tonight. Complete the following:

### Assignment
1. In your `homework` directory, use the `touch` command in terminal to create an index.html file and a style.css file.
1. Open sublime text using the `subl .` command to work on your newly created file. You will be creating a basic **'About Me'** in your `index.html`. Link the html and css files together and do your styling in the `style.css` Your site should have at least the following:
  - Picture
  - Name
  - Small Bio (can be completely false/ just a goof if you'd like)
  - Some interests of yours (possibly in an unordered list)
  - A section containing some useful links (one of which HAS to be **your** github profile)
  - The level of detail you put into this 'mini-site' is entirely up to you, but the more you end up doing the better - practice makes perfect.
1. After you've finished your about me site, go back to your terminal and use `git add .` to add your `homework` directory into the staging area. Then use `git commit -m "Add completed homework for d03"` to commit your work, and then use `git push origin master` to push your committed work to _**your private repo**_.
1. Don't forget to submit an issue for your homework!
1. **GET SOME SLEEP**

### Bonus

1. Look into the CSS :hover property. Try to create some interesting content on hover with your About Me page.
2. Check out the following CSS properties and try to implement them.
 - line height
 - border radius
 - box shadows
 - gradient colors
 - media queries
 - keyframe animations
