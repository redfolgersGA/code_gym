## Introduction
Hello and welcome to Jurassic Park! You have been brought on to manage the dig sites for Dr. John Hammond. No expense has been spared, and the data on each mine is currently stored in the javascript objects below.

## Setup
You will be working in the `d04/homework` directory.
## Completion
Complete all 3 parts.

## Assignment
For each part, copy and paste each code snippet into your browser's javascript console, and use your knowledge of javascript to complete the tasks below! You'll be testing your answers in the console, but a file has already been created in today's student folder called `hammonds_mines.md` for you to write your own notes. After successfully completing each task, you can write and format your answers there!

As you continue to the next parts, make sure to copy and paste the code snippets into the same javascript console you were working in, as the exercises will build up on each other.

## Part 1

```javascript
snakewater_montana = {
  paleontologist: "Dr. Alan Grant",
  depth: "10 meters",
  specimen: "Velociraptor"
}
```

  2. Create a variable called guestOfHonor and assign it's value to the name of the paleontologist at Snakewater, Montana.

  1. Access the value of the specimen found in Snakewater, Montana, and store it in a variable called clever_girl.

## Part 2


```javascript

  nicaragua = {
    depth: "200 meters",
    annual_budget: 1500000,
    specimens: [
      "Tyrannosaurus Rex",
      "Stegosaurous",
      "Triceratops",
      "Velociraptor"
    ]
  }

```

  1. Store the array of specimens of this site into a variable called nicaraguanSpecimens.

  2. Make a variable called favoriteSpecimen and assign it's value to your favorite dinosaur within nicaraguanSpecimens.

  3. Add 250000 to the annual budget of this site.

## Part 3

```javascript
hammonds_mines = {
  buenos_aires: {
    depth: "400 meters",
    annual_budget: 1000000,
    specimens: [
      "Dilophosaurus",
      "Brachiosaurus"
    ]
  },
  mexico: {
    depth: "350 meters",
    annual_budget: 900000,
    specimens: [
      "Gallimimus",
      "Parasaurolophus"
    ]
  }
}
```

  1. Access the depth of John Hammond's mine in Mexico.

  1. Store the depth of the Mexican mine into an appropriately named variable.

  1. Access and the annual budget for Hammond's mine in Buenos Airies.

  1. Store the annual budget for Hammond's mine in Buenos Aires into an appropriately named variable..

  1. Access the dinosaur DNA specimens found in Buenos Aires.

  1. Insert Nicaragua into hammonds_mines

  1. Create three variables to store the annual budgets for each mine into them.

  1. Create a new reasonably named variable to track the total annual cost of operation for the mines by adding the previously stored budgets.

  1. Access the "Parasaurolophus" specimen.
