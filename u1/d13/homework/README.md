## Homework

Since you all did such an awesome job with your first project, we'll have a super easy homework tonight.

You'll just need to watch these three videos on some subjects we'll be covering in Unit 2 - HTTP, Node.js, and AJAX.

There is nothing to turn in, however these videos are not a suggestion. Please spend a little time to take a look at these new concepts.

### Completion
 - Watch all three videos

1. [HTTP!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGOpY2J31pI)
2. [Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8ZLfcHxrD8) video to get a first glimpse at what server side programming is, and how Node.js relates to this side of web development.
3. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEYx8dQr_cQ) will give you a nice introduction to AJAX, which is one of the coolest things we can do with Javascript!


### Questions:
After watching these videos, you should be able to answer:
 - What does asynchronous mean?
 - How does it relate to Javascript development? What are the benefits of Async over synchronous programming?
 - What does HTTP stand for? What are the HTTP verbs?
 - What is the difference between server side and client side (Unit 1) programming?

# Bonus
