Today's morning exercise will consist entirely of problems we've seen in the past, from week 1 until yesterday. Consider where we were all at starting this course and bask in the glory of your amazing progress!

## Setup
Use the script.js and
Write these answers in the provided script.js file.

```
- springfield/

    - couch/
  - school/
    - Lisa.txt
  - power-plant/
    - Homer.txt
```
##### 2. Create a variable called guestOfHonor and assign it's value to the name of the paleontologist at Snakewater, Montana. Access the value of the specimen found in Snakewater, Montana, and store it in a variable called clever_girl.
```
var snakewater_montana = {
  paleontologist: "Dr. Alan Grant",
  depth: "10 meters",
  specimen: "Velociraptor"
}
```

##### 3. In what order will the numbers 1-4 be logged to the console when the code below is executed? Why?
```
(function() {
    console.log(1);
    setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000);
    setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0);
    console.log(4);
})();
