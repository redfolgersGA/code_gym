# Congrats on Project 3!

Nice work on the group projects! You guys deserve a BREAK.

Holiday break is from 12/23/16 - 1/2/17

We will return for class on 1/3/2017 to start **Unit 4**!

### Unit 4
In Unit 4 we will be covering more advanced topics related to everything we've learned so far. Come in ready to learn about Regular Expressions, ECMAScript 6, React.js, testing with Mocha, Webhooks, Redux, functional programming, MongoDB, and other neat web stuff.  

Feel free to check out these these topics by coding, watching videos, reading docs & blogs, or whatever suits your fancy.

 However, it wouldn't be a proper General Assembly holiday break if we gave you no homework... So here is your

### REQUIRD HOLIDAY HOMEWORK:

You guys are the first GA class to get Wes Bos's _React for Beginners_ course provided to you.

**Round of applause for your friendly, well-dressed, and good-at-asking-for-stuff instructional team**

You will have access to videos, Github repos, and a Slack channel emailed to you (hopefully today). This course will give you an excellent starting point coming into Unit 4 (which is SHORT!) so we can start doing interesting things with React as soon as possible. Wes gives a great introduction to many of the tough concepts in React and he's also super cool.

##### Fundamental concepts to watch out for:
* Component architecture
* State
* Props
* JSX

*Heads up*
React is hard (at first). The React approach React is quite different than jQuery, but is generally considered a step forward for organizing complicated UI's. React is simple and powerful once you understand the basic concepts. 

Here's the step process to getting you signed up and set up for the course:

1. You'll receive an email invite to join the React Course (hopefully today).

2. Sign up!

3. Once logged in, click on the Starter Files link beneath the React course description. This will take you to the Course Github Repo.

4. Fork the React-For-Beginners-Starter-Files repo, so that you have a copy of the starter files in your GitHub account.

5. Now go to your Github and go through the process of git cloning your forked copy, so that it is local to your computer. Please clone the repo on your machine but OUTSIDE OF THE X-FILES REPO.

6. You have set up the playground to work in! Niiiiiiice.

7. Now go back to the Wes Bos React Course in the browser and you'll see the option to stream the course videos or download them. You pick! (Download now if you wont have access to internet over the break)

8. From there, you are set to begin! Just follow the videos and Wes's guidance to tackle the course from start to finish.

Bonus!

* Join the course slack channel to get help from Developers around the world as you tackle this course step by step!

##### HW Expectations

We expect the following to be completed during break:

* After every video, git commit the work you've done locally and push it to your Github.

* The entire course must be completed by the 10p on Monday January 2nd, with an issue ticket submitted linking to the course repo and all the work you've done.

* Have fun, breathe and enjoy the break!


# Bonus Part 1: Have fun 

# Bonus Part 2: Seriously, do the React course.
