## Assignment

If you're behind on anything (classwork, Outcomes, etc) take this time to get caught up!

Otherwise, take tonight to relax and decompress. You've earned it.

Below is a list of talks and podcasts that I personally find very inspirational, entertaining and/or informative.

1. Watch any **THREE** of the talks provided below. I highly recommend the first one - Saron is a bootcamp grad turned developer / speaker / podcast host.
1. Listen to **ONE** episode of any podcast listed. I recommend the early episodes of the Ruby Rogues podcast.
