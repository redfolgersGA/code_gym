# SCSS Exercise

## Intro
Spiderman is a web developer who doesn't have time to look after his own website.

He has hired YOU to clean up the CSS in his Rails app. He has heard of this Sassy CSS and he wants his site to be as Sassy as possible!

## Setup
Once you've pulled from upstream, go into the `scss_refactor_exercise` directory and run `bundle install`. This will make sure you have all the dependencies.

The work has already been done in the router, controller, and view file. You will find the stylesheet in the assets folder -  `app/assets/stylesheets/style.scss`. There's some CSS written already in here, your goal is to rewrite it using `SCSS`.

## Assignment
Get in groups of 2 or 3 to complete this exercise.

Use `SCSS` techniques like `variables`, `nested attributes`, and `inheritance` to clean up the `style.scss` file as much as you can!

You will not need to work in the `views/app/index.html.erb` file, or change any of the styling. Just refactor the `app/assets/stylesheets/style.scss` file using what we've learned about SCSS! The site should look the same before and after.

We will review this in about an 45 minutes.

## Hints
 - The p tags and li tags should be 25% the size of the h1
 - The h2 tags should be 50% the size of the h1

## Tips for getting started
 - Take a minute to look at the `style.scss` file
 - What styles are being repeated throughout the stylesheet?
 - Where are the nested elements? How can we utilize SCSS's nested styling to organize our code?
 - Consider how you might use variables to keep the value of certain styles
 - SCSS should help clean up any repetitive styling, and make changes quicker to implement `HINT`
 - Send Jared a Slack message saying "yo i got this" if you read this line.
 - List out the syntax for using SCSS variables, nested attributes, and inheritance. Think about how you can use all of these!
