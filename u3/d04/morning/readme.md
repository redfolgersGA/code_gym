# Morning Exercise - Mo Ruby Methods


## Assignment
Complete each problem below using new Ruby array methods. Documentation for each method below can be found on [here](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html).

### 1) << Method

What does the `<<` keyword do? How could you use it to add `Patrick Star` to the list of characters:
```
spongebob_characters = ["Sandy Cheeks", "Mr. Krabs", "Plankton", "Mrs. Puff"]
```
### 2) & Method

Research the `&` method. What can we use this for? Show an example with the following two arrays.
```
krusty_krab_employees = ["Spongebob Squarepants", "Patrick Star", "Squidward Tentacles"]

bikini_bottom_residents = ["Gary", "Spongebob Squarepants", "Larry the Lobster", "Patrick Star", "Squidward Tentacles"]
```
### 3. cycle Method
Take a look at the docs for the `cycle` Ruby method. Write a method using `cycle` that will print the following array 5 times.
```
im_ready = ["IIIIII'm READY!", "I'm ready", "I'm ready, I'm ready", "I'M READY!"]
```

### 4. rindex Method
Review documentation for the `rindex` method. Use it to find the index of Gary and Larry the Lobster from the `bikini_bottom_residents` array.

### 5. | Method
Checkout the `|` method. How can we use it to grab the unique values between the `krusty_krab_employees` and `bikini_bottom_residents` arrays?

### 6. First and Last
Which methods could you use to grab the first and last elements from the `spongebob_characters` array?

### 7. Sort
Find a method to sort the `bikini_bottom_residents` array by the last letter of each character's name

### 8. Negative index
`im_ready[0]` gives you the first element of the `im_ready` array. What does `im_ready[-1]` give you? Grab each element in the array using a negative index.
