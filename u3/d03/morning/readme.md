You've made it to the big-time: Kanye West wants to hire you to help manage his ego/discography. Put aside whatever personal feelings you may have for the man and get ready for the hardest challenge of your life.

## Assignment

``` ruby
kanye_records = [
{ year: 2016, title: "The Life of Pablo" },
{ year: 2013, title: "Yeezus" },
{ year: 2011, title: "Watch the Throne" },
{ year: 2010, title: "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" },
{ year: 2008, title: "808s and Heartbreak" },
{ year: 2007, title: "Graduation" },
{ year: 2005, title: "Late Registration" },
{ year: 2004, title: "The College Dropout" }
]
```

- Touch a file in your labs folder called 'yeezus.rb'
- Copy the `kanye_records` data structure into that file
  - Think about what kind of data structure we're looking at here!

- Write the following code:

  - print the name of every Kanye record

  - print the year every Kanye record was released

  - look into the future and add a forthcoming Kanye record into our array. It should be released in 2017 and have a title that is completely asinine.

  - iterate through Kanye's record collection and print out the titles of all the records released after Kanye's ego exploded (this happened in 2007).

  - iterate through the collection. For each record, print out a sentence detailing each record. For example, " 'Graduation' was released in 2007"

  - iterate through collection. add a key value pair to each record with the key as `:label` and the value as `"def jam"`.

Complete? Good job! You deserve 'dap'

## SHOULD YOU DO THE BONUS IF YOU HAVE TIME?

- iterate through the collection. if a record's title contains more than 15 letters, print 'that's a long title' to the screen.
- iterate through the collection. replace the letter 'o' in each record title with the number 0.
