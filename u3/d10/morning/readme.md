## Ahoy Mateys!

Heave Ho! Learning to work in teams and sharing code is an important part of a developers career. This morning we are going to get some practice with both! Yo Ho Ho and a bottle of rum - it's a pirate's life for me!

## The Sweet Trade
Shiver me timbers! You scalleywags have one hour to build a Rails Crud App lest ye be forced to walk the plank! Smartly come up with a concept for your app, ye only be needing one model. I can't be imagining anything better than wee rummy Pony app, but ye can be thinking for yerselves. Each seadog needs to be contributing to part of the app and find a way to share yer files with the blessed Captain. Blimey!

*************

###Oh Captain, my Captain

Avast ye rapscallions! Democratically elect your Captain. May they be the Scougiest Scourge of the Seven Seas! Yar! The Captain will host the database on their computer and are responsible for creating the app, model, and schema. Why is the rum gone?

### All hands on deck!
Arrrr, ye remaining landlubbers, buchaneers, swashbucklers, and picaroons need to divey up the remaining booty! Weigh Anchor!

-You be needing to add resources to the routes file, a controller, and all necessary views. Land Ho!
-Create forms using the ruddy form helpers to navigate the stormy #create, #update, and #destroy methods.

Let none of you be swinging the lead...saavy?

### Thar she blows!
Yar me hearties, good work! Lest the Captain be crushing your barnicles or blow'n you down to Davey Jone's Locker, time to merge all yer werk together. Though Jared, the old salt, be not believ'n it possible, Heidi has kept the faith in ye, and holds a glorous bounty on the poop deck for the first ship to sail the seas with a completed app.

#Ysar.
 If ye be confused, read the docks. Argh. If ye be ask'n for help without read'n the blessed prompt ye will be shark bait ye bigle rat!

 John ARRRRRRRR Bell
