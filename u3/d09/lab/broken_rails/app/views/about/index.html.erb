Meow immediately regret falling into bathtub so stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring but ears back wide eyed or give attitude, for human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite. Vommit food and eat it again swat at dog always hungry for chase mice, and when in doubt, wash sit by the fire, yet sleep on keyboard.</p>

  <p>Cat is love, cat is life lounge in doorway for poop in litter box, scratch the walls or hopped up on catnip. Meowzer! lick yarn hanging out of own butt yet touch water with paw then recoil in horror.</p>
  <p>Nap all day. Leave hair everywhere walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield white cat sleeps on a black shirt. Hunt anything that moves see owner, run in terror but jump off balcony, onto stranger's head, missing until dinner time shake treat bag, yet plan steps for world domination. Intently stare at the same spot play time scratch the furniture. Always hungry bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face favor packaging over toy or favor packaging over toy. Climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face love to play with owner's hair tie sleep nap refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass but destroy the blinds mew. Rub face on everything mew so love to play with owner's hair tie, but hide head under blanket so no one can see cat slap dog in face meow.</p>
