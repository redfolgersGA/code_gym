## Morning Exercise - CSS!

![](http://i.imgur.com/9qzBYbH.jpg)

Today we will be looking at the CSS framework [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/color.html). It is a framework, like Bootstrap or Skeleton, that uses the [Material Design principles](https://material.google.com/) laid out by Google.

You use it in the same way as Bootstrap or Skeleton. We just need to read the documentation to find what we're looking for and then add the appropriate class to get our desired styling.

Do all of your work in the index.html file. Do not add any styling to style.css. We will be doing all of our styling here using classes from the Materialize framework.

## Setup
Everything has been provided for you here. Again, the only file you should be working in is the index.html

You will however need to add the Materialize CDN. `Hint` - use this link for the href: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/0.97.7/css/materialize.min.css`

PARTNER UP! Just like with pseudocoding, we should spend **five to ten minutes** planning out our styling.

One person should WIREFRAME the webpage. Draw boxes around elements - it'll help you get a sense of which elements should be nested, where elements belong in the HTML, and which Materialize classes they should be given.

The other person should review the Materialize documentation - what elements and classes do you need to create the appropriate colors, alignment, and spacing?

After five minutes, come together to make a plan to figure out which elements you need and how to incorporate Materialize!

## Completion
Go as far as you can!

## Assignment
You need to recreate the mockup shown here:

Each section should react to a hover. Notice in the second image the larger div has a stronger box shadow. Is there a class to make elements hoverable?
